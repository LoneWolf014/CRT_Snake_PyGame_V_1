# CRT_Snake (Pygame Edition)
*A retro shader playground disguised as a Snake game.*

CRT_Snake is a visual experiment built with **Pygame**, blending the simplicity of classic Snake with the weirdness of old-school **CRT monitors**, manually rendered **3D objects**, and glowing **phosphor-style beam effects** — no shaders, no engines, just pixel math and vibes.

> "I didn’t plan this. I just wanted to see if I could make a beam glow in Pygame. Suddenly it had scanlines, ghost trails, and spinning cubes."
